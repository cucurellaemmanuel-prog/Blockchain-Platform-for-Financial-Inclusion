## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized, transparent financial ecosystem. Users build trust scores through on-chain activities like timely repayments or peer endorsements, unlocking access to loans and investment opportunities. Lenders fund community pools, earning returns while supporting impactful ventures.

**Smart Contracts Overview**  
1. **ProfileRegistry.clar**: Manages user registration, linking wallets to profiles and ensuring unique identities with lightweight on-chain KYC.  
2. **ActivityLog.clar**: Records all user transactions (e.g., payments, endorsements) immutably, providing data for trust scoring.  
3. **TrustScore.clar**: Computes dynamic trust scores based on transaction frequency, consistency, and peer validations, updated regularly.  
4. **MicroFinance.clar**: Issues microloans based on trust scores, defining terms like interest and repayment schedules, funded by lending pools.  
5. **PaymentMonitor.clar**: Tracks loan repayments, applies penalties for defaults, and updates trust scores based on performance.  
6. **CollateralSystem.clar**: Handles digital collateral (e.g., tokens or NFTs) for secured loans, locking/releasing assets per repayment status.  
7. **LendingPool.clar**: Enables lenders to deposit funds into shared pools, distributing profits and supporting loan issuance.  
8. **GovernanceAndArbitration.clar**: Supports community voting on platform policies and resolves disputes via on-chain arbitration.
